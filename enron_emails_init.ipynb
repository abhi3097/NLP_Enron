      "development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not\n",
      "spent no interest is charged on these funds.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a\n",
      "finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as\n",
      "high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000\n",
      "per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at\n",
      "$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000\n",
      "which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to\n",
      "obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement\n",
      "provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the\n",
      "improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would\n",

      "Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total\n",
      "lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably\n",
      "$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The\n",

      "will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the\n",

      "function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain\n",
      "from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.\n",
      "Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is\n",
      "used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own\n",
      "any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track\n",

      "\n",
      "It is a shame that the CAISO doesn't provide actual generation by unit.  The \n",
      "WSCC data, which is dicey and we don't have until July 1999, and the CEMMS, \n",
      "which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposes \n",
      "the CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, but \n",
      "there can be a siginificant difference between \"scheduled\" and \"actual\" \n",
      "generation.  You are pulling \"scheduled.\"  If someone doesn't schedule their \n",
      "generation and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you \n",
      "will miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern california \n",
      "munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is, \n",
      "if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply \n",
      "schedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having said \n",
      "all of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on \n",
      "the generation side.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  While \n",
      "they don't split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is \n",
      "better than the \"scheduled\" number.  The utilities play lots of game on the \n",
      "load side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this with \n",
      "others up here once you have it finished.  I'd like to see how much gas \n",
      "demand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity, \n",
      "especially compared to all gas consumption.  I was surprised by how small the \n",
      "UEG consumption was compared to other uses.  If it is the largest marginal \n",
      "consumer then it is obviously a different story.\n",

      "As shown on the attached summary table, cash expenditures total $21,196 and \n",

      "\n",
      "Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this \n",

      "A conference call was held today with FERC staffers to discuss items of interest or concern to us.  Participating for FERC were Bob Pease (enforcement att'y), Stuart Fisher (economist) and Bruce Poole (engineer).  Alan Comnes, Dave Perrino and I weighed in for Enron.  The laundry list of topics discussed is attached.  We expressed the sentiment that the root cause of all these issues and concerns is the current composition (and non-independence) of the ISO board, and suggested that the ISO board situation should be the subject of the upcoming FERC audit of ISO.  We went on to discuss the audit further and the fact that there is no established or formal comment process.  However, we were invited to file written comments with the Commission on what we thought should be audited, and Alan is taking the lead on this.  We will try to get others to sign on to the comments.  Some of the discussion items that the staff was highly interested in included:\n",
      "\n",
      "\tISO request for a bid from us to prop up the price (staff requested a copy of the transcript).\n",

      "All in all, it was a successful, informal call lasting about 40 minutes.  Staff was receptive to and agreed to receive periodic calls from us in the future.

However, for many standard machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, SVMs, or Logistic Regression, we need to convert this sequence to a fixed-length vector $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$. In the general case, we can define a set of feature extractors $f_i$ for $i = 0,1,\\ldots,d-1$, such that $x_i = f_i([\\mathtt{ids}])$.\n",
